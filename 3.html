  <h1>Javascript</h1>
  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[11] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[12] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[13] often incorporating third-party libraries.[14] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>
